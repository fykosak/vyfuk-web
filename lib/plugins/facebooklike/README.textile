h1. Facebook Like-Button

p. I looked for a realy good Facebook like-button plugin for Dokuwiki but there were only Facebook (http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:Facebook) and fbsp (http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:fbsp) . The first one only creates a big fat like-box and the second one is too simple. So I created a plugin on my own.

h2. Features

# You can fully customize the appearance.
# Easy usage.
# Text-Editor button.

p. Plugin configuration is available in following languages: German, English
